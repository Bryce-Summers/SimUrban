# Programming Guide

Please put all core functions inside othe TSAG namespace.

instead of "class foo", write class TSAG.foo.


Most of the geometries that we will be using will be instantiated at the origin and will be controled through scales, rotations, and positioning.

Because of the grunt build include ordering, super classes need to be included in the html file before sub classes...


Use the Unit_Meshes class for allocating meshes.


My custom defined mesh classes will implement their own clone function.
