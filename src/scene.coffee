    SimUrban Scene Object.
    Rewritten by Bryce Summers on 10.23.2017
    
    purpose: Organizes my algorithm authoring document system.
             This is the root node of all game initialization, storage, and references.

    NOTE: Objects and places are indistinguishable, except that objects are meant to be temporary,
        whereas places are meant to be eternal.
        Places may spawn objects.
