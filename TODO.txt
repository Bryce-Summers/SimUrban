TODO

TODO: Go through and report all three.js bugs, also make sure to update to the latest version of three.js

Implement support for custom line thicknesses on windows...


Put all positioning and scaling functions in one place.

Create a design folder and put various universal properties there.

Create a Model Class that will store the logic for a scene.

Make game scale with the viewport dynamically.

Make sure to roll off different versions. Use Grunt Uglify...


Dispose of THREE.js Geoemtry objects! Make sure we are not leaking memory.


Discretize at different levels of prescision absed on viewport and whether we are using them for collision detection or visual rendering.


NewVertex.

Link Vertices.

Unit test Bryce Data Structures.

Standardize the mechanisms for destroying elements.


Right now, I am working on letting the user draw scribble.js topologically linked polylines and making the cooresponding roads.
- Draw polylines on the screen.
- Maintain a graph with a SCRIBBLE.JS polyline graph post processor.
- Convert 


I would like to hide the THREE.js stuff inside of the element super class and provide an interface with BDS.Points.

 - Implement traffic flow.
 - Implement traffic lights.
 - Lane markings near intersections.
 - Intersection geometry.
 - Detect degenerate geometry.

Roads:
 - Fix cutting topological bug.
 - Have roads produce arcs, instead of quadratic bezier curves.
 - Have highlight be constrained to point in road face, rather than point in road bounding box.
 - Fix endpoint behavior and building a road with a point inside of another road, rather than crossing it with a line.
   The logic is there, but the functionality is not.

 - Fix bugs from degenerate roads, such as those formed when by faulty mouse double clicks in the same place accidently.
 - Detect Road self intersections.
 - Color code the road creation to enhance the user experience.
 - Do legality checking.

 - Investigate Topology Bug.
 - Constrain curves to Pi/2 Radians (90 degrees) max.
 - Create a sophisticated user experience and Legal road detection and feedback to the user.
