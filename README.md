# Transportation_Simulation_And_Game
Sim City for Detail Oriented Transportation Engineering People.

# People
Leader: Bryce Summers, NYU IDM Graduate Student.
Advisor: Jack Bringardner, NYU Professor: General Engineering and Civil Engineering.

# Status
In Progress. I am working on this as a research project at New York Universiy in Collaboration with Transportation Engineers as well as people who care about public policy concerning transit.

# Pull Requests
I don't think I will accept any pull requests until I finish designing and implementing the foundational structure of the game. I plan to develop a standardized way that people can contribute new features and use cases.

By all means, if you have an interest in this project and feel compelled to contribute, submit an issue or a pull request. Thank You!
